                    Aluminium & agricultural waste can be repurposed or sold

                    Economic growth, urbanisation & rising populations lead to more waste

                    Lack of clean water for homes and agriculture, risks of contamination and available storage 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The government plans to provide clean water by 2025 
                    <ul>
                        <li> Bottles of clean water can be purchased for 16000 riel </li>
                        <ul> 
                            <li>  Can swap a bottle for a full bottle for a lower price of 2500 – encourage recycling to save money, increase cash for the community </li>
                        </ul>
                        <li> Rainwater is collected into large plastic drums with 200-300litre capacity </li>
                        <li> Rising water levels are often unpredictable and dangerous</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li> Can be solved to reduce risk and make it safer and more accessible </li>

                    8 public boreholes equipped with hand pumps  
                    <ul>
                        <li> static groundwater level is approximately 5 m below ground </li>

                        <li> boreholes are approximately 30-40 m deep that can pump up to a maximum 4 m3 per hour </li>
                        <ul>
                            <li> Rarely used for drinking as they contain mud, hard water (high calcium carbonate content) and iron  </li>
                            <li> Water only suitable for small scale agriculture – only used domestically as a last resort </li>

                <p>
                    Rainwater collected during the wet season via makeshift channels off corrugated iron roofs into large plastic 200-300 litre drums 
                    <ul>
                        <li> Most people have two or three storage jars </li>
                        <li> One jar can last between three days to a week for household use (cooking, drinking and washing) </li>
                        <li> Cement storage jars cost 150,000 riel (about $40 USD) to buy and deliver to a house </li>
                        <li> No covers - leads to contamination from dirt, insects and potential bacteria  </li>
                        <li> Rainwater often used for washing – boiled if used for drinking </li>

                <p>
                    Women are often responsible for collecting water - will take containers, via walking or motorbike, to groundwater wells and the river 
                    <ul>
                        <li> Households can spend at least 4 hours, every 3 days, collecting water </li>

                            <li> pumps river water into the tank and is driven around to sell water direct to people’s homes </li>

                    Rice, fruit and vegetable farming is significantly relied upon for livelihood and income in Pu Ngaol village 
                    <ul>
                        <li> Rely on rainwater in the wet season - makes them extremely vulnerable to climate effects </li>
                        <ul>

                <p>
                    The government in Cambodia aims to provide universal sanitation by 2030 
                    <ul>
                        <li> Not on track to meet it </li>
                    </ul> 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Stats:
                    <ul>
                        <li> 61% of rural population have access to basic sanitation and hygiene services </li>
                        <li> Over 25% of rural Cambodia don't have access to sanitation services and must process open defecation </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most common toilet is a pour/flush squat latrine that uses water for flushing
                    <ul>
                        <li> toilet paper is uncommon, expensive and also considered unhygienic </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Poor hygiene access increases the risk of water-borne and faecal related diseases  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Diarrhoea is the second largest cause of infant and under 5 mortalities in Cambodia

                <h3> Current Situation </h3>
                <p> 
                    Only 18% of the households in Pu Ngaol have access to a toilet 
                    <ul>
                        <li>There are 20 household toilets and pone public toilet in the community hall  </li>
                        <li> A squatting pan is connected to a septic tank - concrete ring pit for faecal storage </li>
                        <ul>
                            <li> Once a pit becomes full, another pit is dug next to the first one </li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The pits are unsealed - contents leach into the groundwater </li>
                            </ul>
                        </ul>
                        <li> Toilet access can cost between 2-2.5 million riel per toilet, approximately half a community members annual salary </li>
                        <li>  Those without access to the toilet will walk into the forest for privacy, where they are at risk of mosquito bites, insects and snakes  </li>
