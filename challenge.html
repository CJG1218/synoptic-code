                <p>
                   Aims to improve food security in the region through forest and farm protection
                </p>
                <p>
                    Food is expensive - especially fruit. The supply doesn't meet the demand as produce is locally grown on a small scale to be sold at local markets. 
                    <ul>
                        <li> 1 or 2 households buy produce from all others in the village and sell to large market buyers who potentially export it to Vietnam </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many families practice swidden - shifting cultivation + raising plants
                </p>
                <p>
                   Forests are cleared and burned which establishes agricultural land - this is then cultivated with rice. 
                   This is inctercropped with lots of crops and moves on to allow other areas to recover 
                   It eventually returns to the original farm site 
                   In the past, new forest would've been cut, however now its protected under area legislation 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rice farms are the main form of subsidence 
                    <ul>
                        <li> Sold mainly in village for income</li>

                <h3> Current Situation </h3>
                <p>
                    Many meals are rice based - affordable due to the rice farms 
                    <ul> 
                        <li> Served with veg - meat if affordable </li>
                        <li> Spices used to enhance flavour </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p> 
                    Fish are abundant in local Ou Te River 
                    <ul> 
                        <li> Fish often included in means </li>
                        <li> Fermented fish (by bacteria with salt) can last for years in airtight containers - god option for families struggling to afford to eat</li>
                        <li> Nets to catch fish are made from readily available material like bamboo </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many people work as labourers on others' rice farms for income
                    <ul>
                        <li> Only 1 harvest and wet season per year means that each harvest needs to be successful and provide food for a household for a year</li>
                        <li> Each household makes their own rice wine - dangerous if not made correctly and can lead to ill health </li>
                        <ul>
                            <li> Dangerous due to lack of good healthcare facilities - lack of doctors so health risks more severe </li>
                        </ul>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Impacts of climate change are being experienced due to El Niño effect - more severe weather patterns 
                    <ul> 
                        <li> Changing rainfall patterns impact smallholder farmers the most </li>
                        <li> Large impacts when they struggle to secure diversified food + income </li>
                        <li> Large volumes of rain can submerge rice farms for too long - can cause them to spoil </li>
                        <li> Too little rain = less crop growth </li>
                    </ul>

            <p>
                Motorbikes currently most common form of transport + collecting resources 
                <ul> 
                    <li> Every family owns 1 or 2 motorbikes / shares w/ neighbours </li>
                    <li> Tyres can get stuck in dirt road – prevented by wrapping chains around them  </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p> 
                Dirt roads can be in poor condition esp in wet season 
                <ul>
                    <li> Become damaged + inaccessible </li>
                    <li> Affects access to surrounding areas + attendance at school </li>
                    <ul>

                    <li> Connects Pu Ngaol to other homes + farms in village + schools  </li>
                    <li> Bridge can get dammed when water level rises too high – prevents people crossing </li>
                    <li> Bridge not used in dry season – can pass through river area due to low water level </li>
                    <li> Costs 137 million riel – approx $33,000USD </li>

                <h3> Overview </h3>
                <p>
                    Traditional Bunong houses are circular, narrow and tall with thatched roofs
                    <ul>
                        <li> The houses in Pu Ngaol are more similar to a traditional rural Khmer Cambodian house  </li>
                        <ul>
                            <li> Built square / slightly rectangular - almost entirely of wood and a corrugated tin roof </li>
                            <li> Sometimes a balcony platform or an area underneath to sit outside </li>
                            <li> Half the space in homes are open, for families to sleep and sometimes cook in the one area </li>
                            <li> Traditional houses in Cambodia are built on raised stilts with access via stairs or ladders </li>
                            <ul>
                                <li> Protects them from flooding in the wet season </li>
                                <li> Allows wind to pass underneath that creates a natural cooling effect </li>
                            </ul>
                        </ul>

                <p>
                    Wood - most common material used in rural construction, particularly houses, fences for livestock and handicrafts 
                    <ul>
                        <li> Concrete rare in Pu Ngaol </li>
                        <ul> 
                            <li>more common in cities where the Mekong and other rivers are dredged for their riverbed sand to mix into concrete  </li>
                        </ul>
                        <li> Sometimes concrete or clay fired bricks used in rural areas for more expensive houses for a modern look in combination with wood </li>
                        <li> Timber is cut using diesel powered chainsaws </li>
                        <li> Buffalo carts / walking tractor used to take the timber back to village </li>
                        <ul>
                            <li> Used to be a saw mill - closed due to the crackdown on illegal logging  </li>

                        <li> Learnt skills from older generations with skills in the village </li>
                        <li> Skilled community members volunteer their time and coordinate the construction of any new homes </li>
                        <li> Smaller houses - skilled people aren’t hired + community members work together </li>
                        <ul>

                <p>
                    The government plans to provide clean water by 2025 
                    <ul>
                        <li> Bottles of clean water can be purchased for 16000 riel </li>

                            <li>  Can swap a bottle for a full bottle for a lower price of 2500 – encourage recycling to save money, increase cash for the community </li>
                        </ul>
                        <li> Rainwater is collected into large plastic drums with 200-300litre capacity </li>

                <p>
                    Stats:
                    <ul>
                        <li> 61% of rural population have access to basic sanitation and hygiene services </li>
                        <li> Over 25% of rural Cambodia don't have access to sanitation services and must process open defecation </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most common toilet is a pour/flush squat latrine that uses water for flushing
                    <ul>
                        <li> toilet paper is uncommon, expensive and also considered unhygienic </li>

                </p>
                <p>
                    Poor hygiene access increases the risk of water-borne and faecal related diseases  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Diarrhoea is the second largest cause of infant and under 5 mortalities in Cambodia
