                        <h3>Overview</h3>
                        <p>Effective waste management is crucial to prevent environmental damage and health risks. The goal is to reduce and recycle waste.</p>
                        <p>Aluminium and agricultural waste can be repurposed or sold, but e-waste like batteries can only be used once.</p>
                        <p>Economic growth, urbanization, and rising populations lead to more waste, with approximately 44% going to landfills, which harms the environment.</p>
                        <h3>Waste Summit Cambodia</h3>
                        <p>An annual summit gathers stakeholders to discuss waste solutions. The 2023 theme, "Why Waste Separation Matters," covered issues in current waste management systems.</p>
                        <h3>Current Waste Management in Cambodia</h3>
                        <p>Limited waste management exists, especially in rural areas. Major cities have organized systems, but most waste ends up in landfills. Rubbish pickers earn a living by collecting and selling recyclable materials.</p>
                        <p>Senmonorom lacks facilities for processing or recycling waste, although collaboration with the Ministry of Environment has led to the collection of hazardous e-waste.</p>

                        <h3>Current Situation in Pu Ngaol</h3>
                        <p>No waste management system exists in Pu Ngaol. Most waste is burned in piles, and schools use brick incinerators.</p>
                        <p>Some villagers sort waste and sell aluminum cans and plastic bottles. E-waste is often disposed of with regular trash.</p>
                        <h3>Agricultural Waste</h3>
                        <p>Leaves, straw, and husks left after harvest are common. Rice husks are sold or used as animal feed. Cow dung is used as fertilizer.</p>

                        <h3>Overview</h3>
                        <p>There is a lack of clean water for homes and agriculture, with risks of contamination. The government plans to provide clean water by 2025.</p>
                        <p>Clean water can be purchased in bottles, and rainwater is collected in large plastic drums. However, rising water levels are unpredictable and dangerous.</p>

                        <h3>Current Situation in Pu Ngaol</h3>
                        <p>There are 8 public boreholes with hand pumps, but the water is often muddy and high in calcium carbonate and iron, making it unsuitable for drinking.</p>
                        <p>Rainwater is collected during the wet season and stored in plastic drums. Most households have two or three storage jars, but contamination is common due to the lack of covers.</p>
                        <p>Women are responsible for collecting water, often spending hours walking or using motorbikes to reach wells and the river.</p>
                        <h3>Agricultural Water Use</h3>
                        <p>Farming relies on rainwater, making the community vulnerable to climate effects. River water is used for agriculture by those living near the river.</p>
                        <h3>Livestock Water Use</h3>
                        <p>Livestock roam free during the dry season, leading to contamination of water sources. Shallow wells and reservoirs provide water for smaller livestock.</p>

                        <h3>Overview</h3>
                        <p>The Cambodian government aims to provide universal sanitation by 2030, but progress is slow. Poor sanitation increases the risk of water-borne diseases.</p>
                        <p>Diarrhea is a leading cause of infant and under-5 mortality in Cambodia. Most rural populations lack access to basic sanitation services.</p>

                        <h3>Current Situation in Pu Ngaol</h3>
                        <p>Only 18% of households have access to a toilet. Most toilets are pour/flush squat latrines connected to septic tanks.</p>
                        <p>Those without toilets use the forest for privacy, risking mosquito bites, insects, and snakes.</p>
