<h1 >About Pu Ngaol</h1>
<p>
    Pu Ngaol,is a rural village where 547 people live in
    the forested hills of the Mondulkiri province in eastern Cambodia. The village is
    surrounded by rolling forest hills within patrolled wildlife sanctuaries where illegal
    hunting of wild animals and illegal logging is monitored.
</p>
<p>
    Pu Ngaol is home primarily to the Bunong people, Mondulkiri’s largest Indigenous
    group. Their ancestors have been known to live in this area of Cambodia for over
    2,000 years, with their culture and language deeply rooted in the country’s natural
    landscape. It is also home to Khmer families, who make up the majority of the
    population in Cambodia.
</p>

<p>
    The majority of people living in Pu Ngaol practise a subsistence lifestyle, meaning
    everything they need to survive comes from the forest or fields nearby, and have
    honed responsible resource and agricultural practices over time. They live in balance
    with the land to ensure it is preserved for the future and play a key role in maintaining
    and caring for local environments and ecosystems.

</p>
<p>
    The Ou Te River runs through the centre of the village, and for much of the year
    people can only cross to the other side by foot or motorbike over a narrow suspension
    bridge.

    <h1>Challenges in Pu Ngaol</h1>

<p>
    Food Subsistence farmers – everything needed comes from farms + forests Forest protection + conserving resources
    essential to survival Aim – improve food security Overview Many families practice swidden (shifting cultivation
    - raising plants) as main form of agriculture Forest cleared + burned – establishes agricultural land – cultivated
    w/ rice Intercropped w/ lots of veg Moves on to allow other areas to recover Eventually returns to original farm site
    In past – new forest would’ve been cut Not now – restricted under protected area legislation Food = expensive Esp
    fruit Supply doesn’t meet demand Produce locally grown – small scale Sold at local markets -
</p>
<p>
    Toul Village + main
    Senmonorom town market 1 or 2 households buy produce from all others in village – sell to large market buyers -
    potentially export to Vietnam Rice farm – subsistence Sold mainly in village for income Sizes: 20m^2 – smallest
    5,000m^2 – mid + most common 10,000m^2 – largest + less common Methods: Rice grown in water Land dammed to collect
    + retain water from wet season – helps in dry season Modern methods: Grow rice which needs less water Families grow
    rice on same area of land + help each other manage it Farms – organic – no use of fertilizer or pesticides Livestock
    – cows, buffaloes, pigs, ducks, chickens Beef = expensive – not commonly eaten Cows + buffalo – kept mainly for milk
    Chicken, fish + pork – more affordable 1KG meat lasts 1 family 3 days Less frequent in diets depending on how much
    family can afford Livestock free roam in dry season Bamboo fencing put up to keep animals in pens in wet season +
    avoid damage to crops Buffalo confined to forest areas – eats shoots in rice paddies Current situation Majority of
    meals rice based (steamed rice, rice noodles, rice porridge) Served with veg / meat if afforded Spices used to
    enhance flavor Affordable due to rice farms Fish abundant in local river
    smallholder farmers the most Large impacts when they struggle to secure diversified food + income Large volumes of
    rain can submerge rice farms for too long – causes it to spoil Too little rain – less crop growth
